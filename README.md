# Temperature12k

This repository contains data and code generated as part of the Temperature12k project. 

## Manuscripts

### Scientific Data - Data Descriptor

#### Code used to for analysis and figure generation

The data (in a matlab serialization "TS.mat") and Matlab code and used to calculate the maps and proxy composites and generate the figures in the manuscript are included in this directory. The script "createAllFigures.m" will generate Figures 2, 4-8 as seen in the manuscript.

The other functions, scripts and datasets in the directory will are necessary helper functions and data to support the figure plotting scripts. 

### Scientific Data - Analysis

#### Code used to generate 12k reconstructions

The data and code used to produce the reconstructions in Scientific Data Analysis paper, as well as plotting code, is also archived in this repository. These are up to date with the publication version of the paper, but they may not work out of the box on most systems. We hope present some of the methods as notebooks in the future. Please post an issue or get in touch with us if you're having trouble running the code.
